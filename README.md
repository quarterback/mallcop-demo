# Neptune Mallcop Demo

This repository contains a demonstration of the Neptune Mallcop agent auditing tool, which simulates "secret shopper" testing for AI agents to uncover compliance issues, hallucinations, and other risks.

## About Neptune Mallcop

Mallcop is a lightweight agent auditing tool that simulates edge-case user behavior to uncover hallucinations, ethical drift, and compliance violations in deployed chatbots and copilots. It generates structured reports showing exactly how and where your agents fail, so you can fix issues before they escalate into legal, reputational, or customer trust risks.
